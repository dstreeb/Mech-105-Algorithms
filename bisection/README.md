# Bisection Algorithm
This algorithm uses a bracketing guess to find the root of an equation. 


Inputs 

1. Low
* Lower guess 
2. High 
* Upper guess on the positive side of the root (Make sure both guesses bracket the root) 
3.  to
* Percent  relative errror the program will stop at  ( this number will default to 0.0000001) 


Outputs 
1. root 
* This will be the root estimate with the bisection method
